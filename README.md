This project is a small React application that allows users to create and manage a personalized playlist of fake music tracks. The app provides an interactive interface where users can browse artists, add songs to their playlist, change the order of the songs, and remove songs as desired.

# Key Features:

### Add Songs to Playlist:
- Users can browse through a list of predefined artists, each with a selection of songs. By clicking on an artist, users can view their available tracks and add them to their playlist.

### View and Manage Playlist:
- The playlist displays all the songs added by the user, showing the artist name, song title, and duration. Users can see their playlist grow as they add more songs.

### Reorder Songs:
- Users can change the order of the songs in their playlist. This is done by swapping the position of a selected song with the one that follows it, giving users control over the sequence in which songs are played.

### Remove Songs from Playlist:
- Songs can be easily removed from the playlist, allowing users to update their playlist as they like.
